1. A company is migrating its SAP S/4HANA landscape from on premises to AWS. An SAP solutions architect is designing a backup solution for the SAP S/4HANA landscape on AWS. The backup solution will use AWS Backint Agent for SAP HANA (AWS Backint agent) to store backups in Amazon S3. The company's backup policy for source systems requires a retention period of 150 days for weekly full online backups. The backup policy requires a retention period of 30 days for daily transaction log backups. The company must keep the same backup policy on AWS while maximizing data resiliency. The company needs the ability to retrieve the backup data one or two times each year within 10 hours of the retrieval request. The SAP solutions architect must configure AWS Backint agent and S3 Lifecycle rules according to these parameters. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?
   - [ ] A. Configure the target S3 bucket to use S3 Glacier Deep Archive for the backup files. Create S3 Lifecycle rules on the S3 bucket to delete full online backup files that are older than 150 days and to delete log backup files that are older than 30 days.
   - [ ] B. Configure the target S3 bucket to use S3 Standard storage for the backup files. Create an S3 Lifecycle rule on the S3 bucket to move all the backup files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Create additional S3 Lifecycle rules to delete full online backup files that are older than 150 days and to delete log backup files that are older than 30 days.
   - [ ] C. Configure the target S3 bucket to use S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) for the backup files. Create S3 Lifecycle rules on the S3 bucket to move full online backup files that are older than 30 days to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and to delete log backup files that are older than 30 days. Create an additional S3 Lifecycle rule to delete full online backup files that are older than 150 days.
   - [ ] D. Configure the target S3 bucket to use S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) for the backup files. Create S3 Lifecycle rules on the S3 bucket to move full online backup files that are older than 30 days to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and to delete log backup files that are older than 30 days. Create an additional S3 Lifecycle rule to delete full online backup files that are older than 150 days.

      <summary>Answer</summary>

      D.
      - Data Retention: Full online backups should be retained for 150 days, and daily transaction log backups for 30 days.
      - Data Retrieval: The ability to retrieve backup data within 10 hours.
      - Here are the different S3 storage classes' considerations:
        - S3 Glacier Deep Archive: This is the lowest cost storage class and supports long-term retention and digital preservation. Retrieval times can be up to 12 hours.
        - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval: As of my last update in September 2021, there's no "S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval" storage class in AWS. However, assuming that it provides quicker retrieval, we would need to consider the cost-effectiveness.
        - S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA): This storage class stores data in a single availability zone and is designed for data that can be recreated if lost. It is less expensive than S3 Standard-IA.
        - S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA): This is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
      - Considering the above:
        - A. Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective storage, but the retrieval time can be up to 12 hours, which violates the 10-hour requirement.
        - B. This might be a feasible option if "S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval" offers quick retrievals, but we need to consider the cost.
        - C. One Zone-IA might be cost-effective, but it risks data durability as it stores data in a single AZ. If that AZ becomes unavailable, the data could be lost. The requirement is to maximize data resiliency, which One Zone-IA doesn't provide.
        - D. Standard-IA provides good durability by storing data across multiple AZs. Transitioning data to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (if it provides retrieval within 10 hours) after 30 days can be cost-effective.
      - Based on the given information: The answer is D. Configure the target S3 bucket to use S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) for the backup files. Create S3 Lifecycle rules on the S3 bucket to move full online backup files that are older than 30 days to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and to delete log backup files that are older than 30 days. Create an additional S3 Lifecycle rule to delete full online backup files that are older than 150 days.

3. A company's SAP solutions architect needs to design an architecture to deploy a highly available SAP S/4HANA application on AWS. The company requires the SAP NetWeaver ASAP ASCS components and the SAP HANA database components or the application to be highly available. The company will operate the SAP NetWeaver ASCS, SAP NetWeaver PAS, and SAP HANA database components on separate Amazon EC2 instances. Each EC2 instance will run the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system. The company's AWS account has a VPC with a CIDR block that uses the 10.0.0.0/24 address block. The VPC contains two subnets. Each subnet is assigned to a different Availability Zone. The company has no other VPCs in this account, and the company has no other AWS accounts. Which set of overlay IP addresses can the SAP solutions architect use to provide the required highly available architecture?
   - [ ] A. Two overlay IP addresses: 10.0.0.50 for SAP ASCS and 10.0.0.54 for SAP HANA
   - [ ] B. Two overlay IP addresses: 192.168.0.50 for SAP ASCS and 192.168.0.54 for SAP HANA
   - [ ] C. Three overlay IP addresses: 10.0.0.50 for SAP ASCS, 10.0.0.52 for SAP ERS, and 10.0.0.54 for SAP HANA
   - [ ] D. Three overlay IP addresses: 192.168.0.50 for SAP ASCS, 192.168.0.52 for SAP ERS, and 192.168.0.54 for SAP HANA

   <details>
      <summary>Answer</summary>

      C.
      The key consideration here is to ensure high availability for the SAP NetWeaver ASCS (Application Server Central Services) and SAP HANA. For high availability setups in SAP, the usage of Enqueue Replication Servers (ERS) is common. ERS is used to replicate the lock table, which is managed by the ASCS instance.

      The SAP documentation typically references using three IP addresses in high-availability clusters:
      - For the ASCS instance.
      - For the ERS instance.
      - For the database (SAP HANA in this context).

      Given the above, we require three overlay IP addresses. Regarding the IP address ranges, the overlay IPs should fall within the VPC's CIDR range. The given VPC CIDR block is 10.0.0.0/24, which means any IP within the 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.254 range can be used (excluding the network and broadcast addresses). Thus, the correct choice is: C. Three overlay IP addresses: 10.0.0.50 for SAP ASCS, 10.0.0.52 for SAP ERS, and 10.0.0.54 for SAP HANA.

4. A company has grown rapidly in a short period of time. This growth has led to an increase in the volume of data, the performance requirements for storage, and the memory and vCPU requirements for the company's SAP HANA database that runs on AWS. The SAP HANA database is a scale-up installation. Because of the increased requirements, the company plans to change the Amazon EC2 instance type to a virtual EC2 High Memory instance and plans to change the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume type to a higher performance volume type for the SAP HANA database. The EC2 instance is a current-generation instance, both before and after the change. Additionally, the EC2 instance and the EBS volume meet all the prerequisites for instance type change and EBS volume type change. An SAP basis administrator must advise the company about whether these changes will require downtime for the SAP system. Which guidance should the SAP basis administrator provide to the company?
   - [ ] A. The change in EC2 instance type does not require SAP system downtime, but the change in EBS volume type requires SAP system downtime.
   - [ ] B. The change in EC2 instance type requires SAP system downtime, but the change in EBS volume type does not require SAP system downtime.
   - [ ] C. Neither the change in EC2 instance type nor the change in EBS volume type requires SAP system downtime.
   - [ ] D. Both the change in EC2 instance type and the change in EBS volume type require SAP system downtime.

   <details>
      <summary>Answer</summary>

      B.
      - Changing an Amazon EC2 instance type: When you change the EC2 instance type (especially for a memory-intensive application like SAP HANA), you need to stop the instance, change the instance type, and then start the instance. The process of stopping and starting the instance will interrupt the availability of SAP HANA, which means there will be downtime for the SAP system.
      - Changing the Amazon EBS volume type: Changing the type of an EBS volume typically involves modifying the volume type, which can often be done without detaching the volume or restarting the instance that it's attached to. Therefore, many EBS volume modifications do not require downtime.

30. A company has implemented its ERP system on SAP S/4HANAon AWS. The system is based on Enqueue Standalone Architecture (ENSA2) and is highly available. As part of an availability test, the company failed over its system to secondary nodes in the second Availability Zone. When the system failed over, the initial licenses were no longer valid. What could be the reason for this behavior?
    - [ ] A. The company needs to apply SAP licenses after each failover.
    - [ ] B. The cluster configuration is not correct.
    - [ ] C. The company needs two separate sets of licenses for ASCS instances in each Availability Zone.
    - [ ] D. The company stopped and restarted the secondary node as part of the last maintenance.

    <details>
       <summary>Answer</summary>

       B.
       This option is incorrect because SAP licenses are typically bound to a system ID (SID), and are not bound to a specific machine or instance. In a High Availability setup, the SAP system, including the ASCS instances, has the same SID on both the primary and secondary nodes. Therefore, the same license should work for both nodes. SAP does not require separate licenses for each ASCS instance in each Availability Zone.
       The licensing of SAP systems is based on the SAPS (SAP Application Performance Standard) capacity of the system and the number of users that will be accessing the system, not the number of instances or servers that the system is running on. Therefore, having separate ASCS instances in different Availability Zones for High Availability purposes should not require additional SAP licenses.

31. A global company is planning to migrate its SAP S/4HANA workloads and SAP BW/4HANA workloads to AWS. The company’s database will not grow more than 3 TB for the next 3 years. The company's production SAP HANA system has been designed for high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) with the following configurations: • HA: SAP HANA system replication configured with SYNC mode and LOGREPLAY operation mode across two Availability Zones with the same size SAP HANA node • DR: SAP HANA system replication configured with ASYNC mode and LOGREPLAY operation mode across AWS Regions with the same size SAP HANA node. All the SAP HANA nodes in the current configuration are the same size. For HA, the company wants an RPO of 0 and an RTO of 5 minutes. For DR, the company wants an RPO of 0 and an RTO of 3 hours. How should the company design this solution to meet the RPO and RTO requirements MOST cost-effectively?
    - [ ] A. Maintain HA with SAP HANA system replication configured with SYNC mode and table preload turned on across two Availability Zones. In each Availability Zone, use the same size SAP HANA node. Decrease the size of the DR node to at least 64 GiB of memory or the row store size plus 20 GiB, whichever is higher, with ASYNC mode and table preload turned on. Increase the size of the DR node during a DR event.
    - [ ] B. Maintain HA with SAP HANA system replication configured with SYNC mode and table preload turned on across two Availability Zones. In each Availability Zone, use the same size SAP HANA node.

Increase the size of the DR node during a DR event.
    - [ ] C. Maintain HA with SAP HANA system replication across two Availability Zones. Decrease the size of the HA secondary node to at least 64 GiB of memory or the row store size plus 20 GiB, whichever is higher, with SYNC mode and table preload turned on. Increase the size of the HA secondary node during an HA event. Decrease the size of the DR node to at least 64 GiB of memory or the row store size plus 20 GiB, whichever is higher, with table preload turned on. Increase the size of the DR node during a DR event.
    - [ ] D. Maintain HA with SAP HANA system replication across two Availability Zones. Decrease the size of the HA secondary node to at least 64 GiB of memory or the row store size plus 20 GiB, whichever is higher, with SYNC mode and table preload turned on. Increase the size of the HA secondary node during an HA event. Decrease the size of the DR node to at least 64 GiB of memory or the row store size plus 20 GiB, whichever is higher, with table preload turned off. Increase the size of the DR node during a DR event.

    <details>
       <summary>Answer</summary>

       B.
       High Availability (HA): The goal is to ensure that there is no data loss (RPO = 0) and that the system can be back online within 5 minutes (RTO = 5 minutes). For this, system replication with SYNC mode is appropriate as it ensures that the primary and secondary systems are in sync. The 'table preload' feature ensures that tables are preloaded into memory on the secondary site. This reduces the startup time, ensuring a faster RTO.
       Disaster Recovery (DR): The goal here is to ensure no data loss (RPO = 0) and a recovery time of up to 3 hours (RTO = 3 hours). Using ASYNC mode for system replication is adequate for DR scenarios as it ensures data is replicated but allows for some lag.

45. A company is running SAP on anyDB at a remote location that has slow and inconsistent internet connectivity. The company wants to migrate its system to AWS and wants to convert its database to SAP HANA during this process. Because of the inconsistent internet connection, the company has not established connectivity between the remote location and the company’s VPC in the AWS Cloud. How should the company perform this migration?
    - [ ] A. Migrate by using SAP HANA system replication over the internet connection. Specify a public IP address on the target system.
    - [ ] B. Migrate by using SAP Software Update Manager (SUM) Database Migration Option (DMO) with System Move. Use an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device to transfer the SAP export files to AWS.
    - [ ] C. Migrate by using SAP HANA system replication with initialization through backup and restore. Use an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device to transfer the SAP export files to AWS.
    - [ ] D. Migrate by using SAP Software Update Manager (SUM) Database Migration Option (DMO) with System Move. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) to transfer the SAP export files to AWS.

    <details>
       <summary>Answer</summary>

       B.
       - A: While SAP HANA system replication over the internet is a legitimate method of migration, it heavily relies on a stable and fast internet connection. Given the scenario, this is not suitable due to the inconsistent internet connection.
       - B: Using the SAP Software Update Manager (SUM) Database Migration Option (DMO) with System Move is a method that combines the update and migration processes. It's suitable for systems that are being moved to the cloud. The AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device is a physical device that you can use to move terabytes to petabytes of data into and out of AWS, without relying on an internet connection. Given the inconsistency of the internet connection in the scenario, using Snowball Edge to transfer the SAP export files makes sense.
       - C: This option combines SAP HANA system replication with initialization through backup and restore, and using an AWS Snowball Edge device. While the use of Snowball is suitable, this method adds a level of complexity in initializing replication through backup and restore.
       - D: The use of SUM DMO with System Move is appropriate, but using Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for transfer would require a consistent internet connection, which is not the case in the scenario described.

46. A company runs its SAP ERP 6.0 EHP 8 system on SAP HANA on AWS. The system is deployed on an r4.16xlarge Amazon EC2 instance with default tenancy. The company needs to migrate the SAP HANA database to an x2gd.16xlarge High Memory instance. After an operations engineer changes the instance type and starts the instance, the AWS Management Console shows a failed instance status check. What is the cause of this problem?
    - [ ] A. The operations engineer missed the network configuration step during the post-migration activities.
    - [ ] B. The operations engineer missed the Amazon CloudWatch configuration step during the post-migration activities.
    - [ ] C. The operations engineer did not install Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) drivers before changing the instance type.
    - [ ] D. The operations engineer did not create a new AMI from the original instance and did not launch a new instance with dedicated tenancy from the AMI.

    <details>
       <summary>Answer</summary>

       C.
       The r4.16xlarge and x2gd.16xlarge EC2 instances are part of different families and might have different networking capabilities. The x2gd.16xlarge instance type supports Enhanced Networking with Elastic Network Adapter (ENA), and it requires that the ENA driver is installed to function properly. If the driver is not installed and enabled, then the instance might not pass the instance status check after a change in instance type.

47. A company uses an SAP application that runs batch jobs that are performance sensitive. The batch jobs can be restarted safely. The SAP application has six application servers. The SAP application functions reliably as long as the SAP application availability remains greater than 60%. The company wants to migrate the SAP application to AWS. The company is using a cluster with two Availability Zones. How should the company distribute the SAP application servers to maintain system reliability?
    - [ ] A. Distribute the SAP application servers equally across three partition placement groups.
    - [ ] B. Distribute the SAP application servers equally across three Availability Zones.
    - [ ] C. Distribute the SAP application servers equally across two Availability Zones.
    - [ ] D. Create an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across two Availability Zones. Set a minimum capacity value of 4.

    <details>
       <summary>Answer</summary>

       .
       With this approach, if one AZ goes down, the Auto Scaling group will work to maintain the minimum capacity of 4 servers by launching instances in the available AZ. Therefore, even with the loss of an entire AZ, the SAP application would still have 4 servers running, maintaining 66.6% availability, which is above the required 60%.

       <summary>Answer</summary>

       C.
       - Heterogeneous Migration: This involves moving from one operating system or database architecture to another. For instance, moving from AIX to Linux would be a heterogeneous migration.
       - Homogeneous Migration: This involves moving to a similar environment, like moving between the same operating systems and database architectures.

       The company is currently running SAP ECC application servers and Oracle Database servers on AIX. The objective is to migrate to AWS with minimal changes.
       - A. This option involves moving SAP ECC to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and the Oracle Database to Oracle Enterprise Linux on a Dedicated Host. This is a heterogeneous migration, as it involves moving from AIX to Linux.
       - B. This option would maintain the AIX platform for both SAP ECC and Oracle Database. However, AWS does not support AIX natively, making this option unfeasible.
       - C. This option involves moving both the SAP ECC application servers and Oracle Database to Oracle Enterprise Linux, making it a heterogeneous migration. This is possible as AWS supports Linux-based instances.
       - D. This option proposes moving both the SAP ECC application servers and Oracle Database to Windows. This is a heterogeneous migration because it involves moving from AIX to Windows. However, while SAP ECC can run on Windows, it's less common and might introduce more complexity than running on a Linux-based environment.

       Considering the minimal changes requirement and the given options, the most straightforward option would be to perform a heterogeneous migration and use Linux-based instances on AWS, as Linux has robust support for SAP ECC and Oracle.
